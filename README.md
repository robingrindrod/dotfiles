# dotfiles
Configuration files for Zsh, Vim, tmux, etc.

## Installation instructions
The files in this repository can be copied or symlinked manually but I recommend
using GNU Stow. Each set of configuration files can then be installed with the
following command:

    stow <configuration dir> -t ~
